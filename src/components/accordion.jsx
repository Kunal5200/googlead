            Our audit is thorough and comprehensive. Typically, the process
            takes between 1-2 business days. This timeframe ensures that we
            meticulously analyze every aspect of your Google Ads account and
            provide actionable insights. Youâ€™ll receive a detailed report at the
            end of this period.

            If you have multiple Google Ads accounts, we can certainly audit
            each one of them. Each account will be treated as a separate audit.
            For multiple accounts, we recommend reaching out to our team
            directly, and we may be able to offer a bundled discount or package
            deal based on the number of accounts
